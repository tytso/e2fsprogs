.SH NAME
mklost+found \- create a lost+found directory on a mounted
ext2/ext3/ext4 file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mklost+found
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mklost+found
is used to create a
.I lost+found
directory in the current working directory on an ext2/ext3/ext4
file system.  There is normally a
.I lost+found
directory in the root directory of each file system.
.PP
.B mklost+found
pre-allocates disk blocks to the
.I lost+found
directory so that when
.BR e2fsck (8)
is being run to recover a file system, it does not need to allocate blocks in
the file system to store a large number of unlinked files.  This ensures that
.B e2fsck
will not have to allocate data blocks in the file system during recovery.
.SH OPTIONS
There are none.
.SH AUTHOR

maintained by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@alum.mit.edu>.
