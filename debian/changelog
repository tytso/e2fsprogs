    #162297).
  * Generate udeb package for debian-installer (Martin Sjögren, Closes:

    it from the wrong location where it was, in preinst.  Hopefully noone
    noticed.
  * Also have old scripts/e2fsprogs.mkinitrd removed.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.6, no change.  3.5.7 will need a bit
    of work but not tonight.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Sep 2002 01:46:25 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.28-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "this time it will work ! (famous last words)" release.
  * Now that it builds, ensure the dir in which we install this damn mips
    non-pic lib exists.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Sep 2002 00:04:49 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.28-4) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Sep 2002 21:19:19 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.28-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use special cflags at configure time when building the special
    mips non-pic lib, in yet another attempt to fix my adaptation of the
    patch from the mips team.  Also added --disable-nls which was present
    in the original patch.  
  * Remove debian/BUILD-MIPS on clean.
  * Install mkinitrd script as scripts/e2fsprogs, not as
    scripts/e2fsprogs.mkinitrd.

e2fsprogs (1.27+1.28-WIP-0626-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Remove bogus shlibs deps on "e2fsprogs (>= <current>)"

 -- Theodore Y. Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>  Sat, 17 Aug 2002 17:59:17 -0400

e2fsprogs (1.27+1.28-WIP-0626-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release:
  ** Supports v2 ACL format (Closes: #138160).
  * Removed explicit --mandir flag, as it now uses FHS man location by
    default.
  * Added mkinitrd script, "upstream-contributed" ;) by Ted Ts'o (Closes:
    #148064).
  * Build a no-pic version of libext2fs.a on mips and mipsel, patch by
    Florian Lohoff, adapted for style consistency (Closes: #145432).
  * Removed presumably-useless and presumably-broken CFLAGS propagation.
    If someone misses that, I'll add ${CFLAGS} to --ccopts.
  
  * Switched to debhelper v4.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to all packages' Depends field.
  
  * Fixed typos in fsck.8, added an example for clarity (Closes:
    #145044).
  * Fixed typo in chattr manpage (Closes: #141938).
  * Fixed typo in tune2fs manpage (Closes: #148514).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Jul 2002 00:12:33 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.27-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium since this fixes a RC bug.
  * Generate the shlibs file instead of just copying it in place, and make
    it produce deps on "e2fsprogs (>= <current>)" as well, to cope with
    new functions introduced in the libs (Closes: #139274).
  * Added a note on this in README.Debian.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Mar 2002 23:58:48 +0100

e2fsprogs (1.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #136737).
  * No more use for dh_link'ing *.ext[23], it's now done by upstream
    Makefiles.
  * Only include (new) inode_io.o from libext2fs when fileio.o is, or the
    BF build fails because of this additional (unused) member (upstream
    hint).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Mar 2002 00:17:32 +0100

e2fsprogs (1.26-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simple rebuild after fixing the settings of my computer's clock, so
    that katie accepts to install the package.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Feb 2002 14:53:15 +0100

e2fsprogs (1.26-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied upstream patch dealing with the rlimit filesize variation
    among archs and kernel versions (Closes: #133909).
  * Create fsck.ext3.8 symlink (Closes: #121526).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Feb 2002 06:44:02 +0100

e2fsprogs (1.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This uploads fixes 10 bugs, including data-corruption problems, and
    adds much to the ease of maintainance and problem tracking.  Good
    choice for woody.
  
  * New upstream release (Closes: #106622, #116975, #118443, #119624,
    #120171, #120077, #129828, #132764).
  ** Fixes for data-corruption bugs not reported to the BTS: e2fsck
    trashed external journals needing to be replayed, e2fsck now hides
    visible journal files (data corruption problems when not excluded from
    a backup and then restored) (Closes: #132654).
  ** Other noticable bugs fixed include: e2fsck null pointer
    dereferencing, fsck did not finds LVM volumes by UUID or by label,
    largefile support (ie. dealing with filesystems inside 2GB+ files) was
    broken in several programs.
  * Switch to debhelper v3 to get ldconfig automatically handled
    (lintian reported that it was broken).  Now call dh_makeshlibs, but
    still override its generated shlibs file with ours, to get compiled
    packages depend of the correct virtual packages, which include
    full sonames.
  * Removed call do dh_installman (Closes: #115526).
  * Cleaned up maintainer scripts with dead code - most things are now
    more properly handled by debhelper.  Removed an "exit 0" lurking in
    preinst - can't find a reason for it in the changelog, it was probably
    here for ages.
  * Remove obsolete maint-scripts in binary-arch, as they are provided by
    upstream.
  * Also remove upstream-shipped config.cache before configuring.  That
    shouldn't impact us, but well, that makes lintian happy :)

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 06:12:35 +0100

e2fsprogs (1.25-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream bugfix release (Closes: #112414), targeted to woody.
  * com_err.info provided again now that it was fixed upstream.
  * Added metainfo to com_err.texinfo so that it gets indexed correctly
    (thanks lintian).  Moved @setfilename and @settitle to the top so that
    things get output as expected.
  * Added lintian overrides for -bf and -static packages.
  * Put all stamp files in debian/stampdir.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 16:22:47 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.24a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release (Closes: #109577).
  ** The only new code in there is in codepaths that
    are only visited when previously unsupported features are used, so
    they add virtually no risk.  Support for raw image files will be of
    great help to debug users' problems.  Urgency set to "high" to make
    sure this version gets released with woody.
  
  ** Fsck prints a warning message if now valid filesystems are passed to
    it. (Closes: #107458).
  ** Fsck -A will not try to interpret device names for filesystems which
    have a pass number is 0. (Closes: #106696).
  ** If -O none is passed to mke2fs, it will now not set the sparse_super
    feature (Closes: #108165).
  ** Tune2fs has been fixed to make sure that only error messages go to
    stderr, and normal message go to stdout (Closes: #108555).
  ** Minor man pages updates (Closes: #30833, #108174).
  ** Doc fixes (Closes: #110621).

e2fsprogs (1.22-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This is only a trivial patch to stop some user confusion, and would be
    great to have in woody, hence the urgency.
  * Applied upstream patch to e2fsck to warn user when some errors were
    not corrected due to user answering "no" (Closes: #104502).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Jul 2001 23:01:49 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.21+1.22-WIP-0620-1) unstable; urgency=low

e2fsprogs (1.20-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup generated substvars files now that debhelper uses other
    names (may cause problems on other archs).  Build-dep on debhelper
    3.0.30 or newer to be sure it won't cause broken uploads.  Allows to
    get rid of hairy dep, but cannot build straightforwardly on potato any
    more...

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jun 2001 02:33:32 +0200

e2fsprogs (1.20-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved debugfs back from /usr/sbin/ to /sbin/ (Closes: #97035).
  * Moved e2label back to /sbin/ as well, as it is now a hard link to
    tune2fs.
  * New binary package with statically linked e2fsck, recommending a
    statically linked shell (Closes: #62611).
  * All deps against e2fsprogs itself now versionned (lintian).
  * Updated copyright file (upstream location, packaging copyright notice
    for previous maintainers and for Alcove).
  * Remove call to dh_testversion, use versionned build-dep instead
    (lintian).
  * Support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug/nostrip for policy 3.2
    compliance.
  * Use dh_shlibdeps -l instead of setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitely -
    necessary for new versions of fakeroot, and requires debhelper 3.0.23
    for a fix.  Well finally 3.0.23 is buggy, leave this for later.
  * Avoid to call ldconfig at "make install" time, too costly.
  * Get rid in control files of references to never-released standalone
    lib files (split attempted in 1997/98).

e2fsprogs (1.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Fixes: Bug#33113).
  * All patches we used for 1.12 are obsoleted by 1.14.
  * Still have to install com_err.info from debian/rules though.
  * Incorporated patches from Gordon Matzigkeit for hurd cross-compilation:
  * - configure.in: Change cross-compile default for sizeof (long
      long) to 8, so that __s64 and __u64 get defined in ext2fs.h.
      (BUILD_CC): Discover a native compiler if we are cross-compling
      (used for util/subst).
    - Include linux/types.h instead of asm/types.h, so that
      non-Linux platforms use the stubbed version provided with this
      package.
    - misc/Makefile.in (findsuper): Add a rule so that findsuper gets built
      with the right compiler flags.
    - etc.
