Description: ext2 / ext3 / ext4 file system driver for FUSE
 fuse2fs is a FUSE file system client that supports reading and
 writing from devices or image files containing ext2, ext3, and ext4
 file systems.

Description: save the output of a command in a log file
 The logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified
 argument(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the
 containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will
 accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A copy
 of the output will also be written to standard output.

Description: statically-linked version of the ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem checker
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.

Description: ext2/ext3/ext4 file system utilities - translations
 The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
 ("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for
 hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package provides translations for messages for programs found in
 the 'e2fsprogs' package.

 libcomerr is an attempt to present a common error-handling mechanism to
 manipulate the most common form of error code in a fashion that does not
 have the problems identified with mechanisms commonly in use.

Description: command-line interface parsing library
 libss provides a simple command-line interface parser which will
 accept input from the user, parse the command into an argv argument
 vector, and then dispatch it to a handler function.
 .
 It was originally inspired by the Multics SubSystem library.

 a simple command-line interface parser, the include files needed to
 compile and use it, and the static libs.
 .
 It was originally inspired by the Multics SubSystem library.
 .
 This package contains the development environment for the ss library.

Description: stripped-down versions of e2fsprogs, for debian-installer
 This package is an e2fsprogs package built for a reduced size, so that
 it can help to save space in debian-installer.
 .
 Don't attempt to install this package, it has no support for a couple of
 features you surely want.  Anyway it should refuse to install.

Description: ext2/ext3/ext4 file system libraries
 The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
 ("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for
 hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package provides the ext2fs and e2p libraries, for userspace software
 that directly accesses extended file systems. Programs that use libext2fs
 include e2fsck, mke2fs, and tune2fs. Programs that use libe2p include
 dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr.

Description: ext2/ext3/ext4 file system utilities
 The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
 ("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for
 hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains programs for creating, checking, and maintaining
 ext2/3/4-based file systems.  It also includes the "badblocks" program,
 which can be used to scan for bad blocks on a disk or other storage device.
