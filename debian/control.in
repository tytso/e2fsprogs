Description: statically-linked version of the ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem checker
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.
