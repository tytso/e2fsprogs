Description: statically-linked version of the ext2 filesystem checker
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.

Description: command-line interface parsing library
 This package includes a tool that parses a command table to generate
 a simple command-line interface parser, the include files needed to
 compile and use it, and the static libs.

 libuuid generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's).
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .

 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs),
 especially time-based UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion,
 even in the face of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s
 running on different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the
 uuidgen program.
