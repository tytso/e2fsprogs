ext2fs_check_desc: Corrupt group descriptor: bad block for inode table
../e2fsck/e2fsck: Group descriptors look bad... trying backup blocks...
Note: if several inode or block bitmap blocks or part
of the inode table require relocation, you may wish to try
running e2fsck with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem
may lie only with the primary block group descriptors, and
the backup block group descriptors may be OK.

Inode table for group 1 is not in group.  (block 4294967295)
WARNING: SEVERE DATA LOSS POSSIBLE.
Relocate? yes

One or more block group descriptor checksums are invalid.  Fix? yes

Group descriptor 1 checksum is 0x6ea2, should be 0x7edd.  FIXED.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
