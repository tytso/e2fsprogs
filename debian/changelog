e2fsprogs (1.47.2~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
  * Remove the -r option from tune2fs and replace it with an extended
    option since most users will never need to request a file system
    suitable for pre-1995 1.2 version kernels and a typo will just end up
    confusing the user and leaving them with a file system missing most
    modern ext4 features, including no support for on-line resizing and no
    support for post-2038 timestamps.   (Closes: #1086603)
  * Add support for gnu.translator extended attrbutes in tar files fed to
    mke2fs -d.
  * Avoid a spurious failure in badblocks when -n or -w is specified
    twice.  (Closes: #1087341)

    orphan_file feature if there are orphaned files which need to be
    cleaned up.
  * Fix a bug which caused tune2fs to corrupt a revision 0 file system
    when changing the inode size by updating the revision to the current

    is available.
  * Install a udev rule to inihibit ext4 file systesm from being
    automounted by udisks.
  * Debugfs's 'hash' command has been enhanced to use the hash seed and
    algorithm from a superblock if a file system is opened and to display
    the hash seed and algorithm if the -v flag is given.
  * Teach mke2fs with a new extended options, root_perms, which overrides
    the permissions for the root directory for the new file system.
  * Preserve any error indicator in the superblock when replaying the
    journal so that a subsequent fsck can repair the file system afterwards.
  * Fix potential mke2fs failures when creating a file system with an
    orphan file when the storage device has a previous file system and
    does not support discard/trim commands.
  * E2fsck will clear the orphan_present feature silently in preen mode.
  * Fix potential checksum failures when performing an online resize when
    the mounted file system is actively modifying the superblock.
  * Fix a bug where a checksum failure in an htree directory can cause
    e2fsck's preen mode to abort unnecessarily.
  * Fix e2fsck's handling of an invalid symlink in an inline_data
    directory.
  * Fix e4crypt from issuing a spurious "success" error message when

    edge cases.
  * Fix e2fsck to correctly update quota usage after optimizing

    fuzzed file system.
  * Fix dumpe2fs to report free block ranges correctly for bigalloc file
    systems.

    free cluster count in the last block group and the total free clusters
    count to be incorrect.
  * Avoid spurious e2scrub failures caused by trying to scrub file
    syustems that do not have the journal enabled, and by aborting scrub
    runs while upgrading the e2fsprogs package
  * Teach tune2fs to detect a file system which is mounted but is not
    mentioned in the mount namespace where tune2fs is run by treating a
    block device which is busy as if it is mounted.
  * If tune2fs can't find the mountpoint for a file system which is
    apparently mounted (perhaps because it's not present in the current
    mount namespace) when attempting to set the label or UUID in the
    superblock, fall back to the old method of modifying block device and
    silence printing any error messages.
  * If both the primary superblock and first block group's backup
    superblock are corrupted, e2fsck will now try additional backup
    superblocks if they are available.
  * Avoid mke2fs from creating an invalid file system with an insufficient
    number of inodes when creating a file system which is very small
    (100k), a block size of 1k, and an inode size of 256 bytes.

    may be calculated using either the signed or unsigned char variant,
    but new xattr entries will be set using the unsigned variant.  Since
    this difference is only seen for extended attribute names that contain

    dependency was not noticed for over two decades.
  * E2fsck will now check to make sure the journal inode does not have the

  * E2fsck will now find and fix file system corruptions when the encrypted
    files have a different policy from their containing directory.
  * The "htree" command in debugfs now displays the metadata checksums for
    hash tree index blocks.
  * Fix various bugs where a maliciously corrupted file systems could case
    e2fsck and other e2fsprogs programs to crash.
  * Dumpe2fs will print the error code that Linux kernels newer than v5.6
    will save to indicate the class of error which triggered the ext4_error
    event.
  * E2fsprogs programs (in particular, fuse2fs) can now update htree
    directories without clearing the htree index.
  * Tune2fs will properly recalculate directory block checksums when
    clearing the dir_index feature.
  * Fix a bug in e2fsck directory rehashing which could fail with ENOSPC
    because it doesn't take into account the space needed for the metadata
    checksum, and doesn't create a sufficiently deep index tree.
  * Clarify the e2fsck messages when it resets the directory link count when
    it is set to the overflow value but it is no longer needed.
  * Mke2fs now sets the s_overhead_cluster field, so that the kernel doesn't
    need to calculate it at mount time.  This speeds up mounting very large
    file systems.
  * Speed up mke2fs when creating large bigalloc file systems by optimizing
    ext2fs_convert_subcluster_bitmap().
  * The filefrag program can now request the kernel to display the extent
    status cache by using "filefrag -E".  (This requires Linux version 5.4
    or newer.)

e2fsprogs (1.45.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Mke2fs will now warn when creating a file system on a DAX-capable
    device and the block size is incompatible with DAX.
  * The chattr and lsattr programs now support using the 'x' attribute
    to set/get dax support on a particular file.
  * E2fsprogs now supports the gnu.* extended attribute namespace, which
    allows mke2fs -d to import the gnu.translator extended attributes.
  * Add support for the simultaneous enablement of the casefold and
    encryption features, which ext4 supports starting with the v5.5
    Linux kernel.
  * Debugfs will now retry opening the superblock if it finds that the
    superblock has an invalid checksum, since this could happen when
    opening a mounted file system.
  * Fix an off-by-one error when validating the depth of an htree which
    caused e2fsck to potentially fail to notice an invalid htree.
  * Fix potential buffer overrun in e2fsck when scanning directory blocks
    in pass 2. (Addresses Google Bug: #158564737)
  * Fix tune2fs so that it unlocks the MMP block if it can't perform the
    requested operation.
  * Fix mke2fs so it can import the contents of a directory using the -d
    option when it has inode numbers that are greater than 2**32.   Also
    fix an omission where the extended attributes on the top-level directory
    was not getting copied to the root directory.
  * Fix e4crypt so that the add_key operation uses the explicitly provided
    salt if it is provided.
  * Fix resize2fs to prevent it from overflowing the block group descriptors
    from overflowing the first block group.  (This can only happen when the
    block size is 1k and the file system is very large.)
  * Fix debugfs's set_super_value command so it can set 64-bit integer
    fields, such as s_kbytes_written.
  * Fix filefrag so that it won't crash if the kernel returns zero for
    statfs(2)'s device id or if it returns a blocksize of zero the device's
    blocksize.
  * Fix a few bad error code returns in the unix and sparse I/O managers.
  * E2fsck will no longer try to fix duplicate file names in an encrypted
    directory by mutating the encrypted file name.

    project.
  * Update the Debian policy compliance to 4.5.1

    resize2fs where a carefully/maliciously corrupted file systems (found
    by American Fuzzy Lop) could these programs to crash or hang.
    (Closes: #868489)
  * E2fsck no longer issues some harmless bitmap warnings caused by a
    corrupted file system; since those corruptions will be fixed up by

    extents from indirect block maps) so that it handles sparse files
    correctly.

  * Removed a debugging printf in libsupport which could result to some
    extraneous and confusing output if the user specifies a quota type.

  * Fix e2fsck so it does not try to write back block group descriptors
    if they have not been modified.
  * The mke2fs program will now place metadata blocks in the last

  * The debugfs command "set_inode_field" will now automatically
    allocate blocks for indirect blocks and extent tree blocks.

    of the disk (instead of relative to the beginning of the partition),
    controlled via a mke2fs.conf configuration parameter.
  * Fix a bug which caused e2fsck to abort a journal replay on a file
    system with bigalloc enabled.  (Closes: #744953)
  * Fix mke2fs so it more correctly handles large flex_bg counts
  * Mke2fs will check the kernel version number and not just the sysfs
    feature flag to determine whether it is safe to enable lazy
    inode table initialization, so it won't get faked out if the ext4 is
    compiled as a module which hasn't happened to be loaded yet.
  * E2fsck will now automatically fix a last mount time or last write time
    which is in the future in preen mode.
  * Mke2fs will now check the file system revision number requested by the
    command line, and reject it if it is too large.
  * If filefrag runs into an error, it will continue processing the rest
    of the files specified on the command line, but then exit with an

  * Filefrag now prints some additional new flags (such as
    FIEMAP_EXTENT_ENCODED), and print unknown flags as hex values.

e2fsprogs (1.42.10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
  * The mke2fs program no longer requires a force (-F) option when
    when creating a file system in a regular file, since this is a very
    common use case when managing virtual machine images
  * The mke2fs program will now ask for confirmation before wiping out a
    pre-existing file system, partition label, or physical volume
  * Fix e2fsck so that it properly handles an inconsistent quota inode.
    Previously the quota inode could be completely corrupted, and
    missing quota records could be not noticed
  * Fix mke2fs so if packed metadata blocks are enabled that the block
    group checksum are set correctly
  * Debugfs has new commands to allow the quota inode to be queried directly
  * Tune2fs will allow removal of dirty journal with two "-f" options
    (Closes: #559301)
  * Fixed some off-line resize2fs bugs when relocating metadata blocks
    when growing or shrinking bigalloc file systems
  * Fixed resize2fs's calculation of the minimum required file system
    size.  This allows resize2fs -M to shrink the file system more
    aggressively
  * Fixed resize2fs to properly handle shrinking a very large and empty
    file system to a very very small size
  * Fixed e4defrag to work with 64-bit and bigalloc file systems
  * Fixed e2fsck to not issue a large number of very scary (but
    harmless) corruption messages when checking very large file systems
    when the file system has more inodes than the number of seconds
    since January 1, 1970.
  * E2fsck will now check the whole file system if file system problems
    are detected during its initial "pass 0" sanity check
  * Filefrag now prints the "shared extent" flag which is used by some
    file systems such as btrfs
  * The mke2fs program would previously correctly omit the resize_inode
    feature when creating a file system > 16TB when the fs size was
    determined automatically.  It will now also do the right thing when
    the user explicitly specifies the file system size.
  * The message printed by logsave is now much less scary (Closes: #468821)
  * Fix spelling typo in the package descriptions
  * Update Czech, Dutch, French, German, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, and
    Vietnamese translations (Closes: #703048)

  * Fix off-line resizing of file systems with flex_bg && !resize_inode
    (Closes: #696746)
  * Change mke2fs so that it does not set the root directory to the real
    uid/gid of the mke2fs process.  Add the extended option root_owner to
    override this behavior.
  * If an invalid journal size is given to mke2fs, it will now complain
    and exit sooner.
  * Fix resize2fs when shrinking file systems to make sure that bitmap
    blocks aren't left outside the bounds of the shrunken file system.
    This could happen with flex_bg file systems that were grown using
    the old online resizing algorithm.
  * E2fsck will now detect and repair corrupted extent trees which contain
    invalid extents at the end of the extent tree leaf block.
  * E2fsck will now longer complain about zero length extended attribute values.
  * Fix a regression introduced in e2fsprogs v1.42 which caused e2image -s
    to crash.
  * Add safety check so tune2fs will not attempt to set the inode size to
    be larger than the block size.
  * Enhance chattr to allow clearing the extent flag if the kernel allows it
  * Fix e2image with large (> 32-bit) file systems (Closes: #703067)

    quiet mode.
  * Debugfs was erroneously giving spurious error messages for certain
    extent_inode subcommands which take arguments (split_node,
    replace_node, and insert_node).  This has been fixed.

  * Added new options to filefrag to be consistent with the version from
    Lustre
  * Optimized e2fsck's CPU utilization
  * Fixed e2fsck so it detects and fixes inconsistencies in the interior
    nodes of an inode's extent tree
  * Fixed a potential memory corruption failure in e2fsck's error path if
    the call to ext2fs_open2() fails.
  * Fixed e2fsck if its logging function is enabled in e2fsck.conf, and
    the resulting file name for the log file is longer than 100 bytes,
    that it properly handles this situation instead of crashing.
  * E2fsck will now report the amount of memory that it attempted to
    allocate when a memory allocation request fails, to make it easier to
    track down the problem.
  * Fixed a bug in resize2fs which could cause severe file system
    corruption when growing an ext4 file system which was formatted with
    fewer-than-normal reserved gdt blocks
  * Fixed resize2fs to be able to handle off-line resizes of file
    systems with the flex_bg feature and without any reserved gdt
    blocks or if the file system did not have the resize_inode feature
  * Further optimize resize2fs so it doesn't use quite as much CPU when
    resizing very large file systems.
  * Fixed 32-bit overflow bugs which could cause resize2fs to fail and
    possibly corrupt the file system while resizing 64-bit file systems.
  * Fixed a big which could cause resize2fs to corrupt bigalloc file systems.
  * Fix a crash while mke2fs is parsing "-E resize=NNN" with the 64bit
    file system feature enabled
  * Added better error checking to mke2fs to check for invalid
    parameters when creating bigalloc file system.
  * When creating bigalloc filesystems, the -g option to mke2fs will now
    specify the number of clusters per block group.
  * Added the "symlink", "zap_block", "block_dump", and "extent_open"
    commands to debugfs
  * Fixed debugfs's htree command so that all its messages are sent
    through the pager.
  * Fixed debugfs's dump_file and cat functions so they work correctly
    on file systems with a block size greater than 8k.
  * Fixed mke2fs's handling of the mmp_update_interval option
  * Fixed e2freefrag so it works on 64-bit file systems, and so it uses
    much less memory.
  * E2image can now include all data blocks in the e2image output
    file when the user specifies the -a option.
  * Fixed debugfs's mknod command so that it updates the block group
    statistics
  * Document the bigalloc feature in the mke2fs man page.

    init script) to hang (Closes: #682592)
  * Fix a problem if e2fsck where if the root file system is mounted
    read-only, e2fsck would not clear an error indication in the journal
    superblock.  Combined with a kernel bug, this would cause the e2fsck
    to check the file system after every single boot
  * Fixed filefrag so it would not seg fault on virtual filesystems such
    as /proc: e.g., "filefrag /proc/partitions"
  * Fix filefrag so that it correctly reports the number of extents
  * Fixed a bug which caused "mke2fs -N 256 -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 256m"
    to write blocks out until /tmp filled
  * Fixed a bug in how e2fsck would uniquify directory entry names
  * Change e2fsck so it will allow file systems mounted read-only to be
    checked with the -f option.
  * Fix e2fsck so that the file system is marked as containing an
    error if the user chooses not to fix the quota usage information.
  * Fix tune2fs so that it correctly removes the quota feature when
    the last quota inode is removed.
  * Fix tune2fs so that after removing a quota inode, the block bitmap
    is updated; otherwise, e2fsck would complain after running 'tune2fs
    -O ^quota <dev>'.
  * Fix tune2fs so that when converting a file system from using legacy
    quota files to the new quota file system feature with hidden quota
    files, the accounting for these files is handled correctly so that
    e2fsck doesn't complain.
  * The e4defrag program now allows device symlinks, such as

      in pass1b handling if the file system does not support extended
      attributes.
  * E2fsck will be more careful accidentally asking the user to continue
      if the file system is mounted, so that an escape sequence won't
      cause a false positive.  (Closes: #619859)
  * E2fsck now uses less cpu time in pass 5
  * E2fsck will no longer segfault when a corrupted file system has a bad
    extent, and removing it leads to a block needing to be deallocated.
  * E2fsck now supports an extended "discard" option which will cause
      e2fsck to attempt discard all unused blocks after a full check
  * The e2image program now supports the qcow2 format, a more efficient
      way of capturing file system metadata snapshots.
  * Mke2fs now supports the [devices] stanza in mke2fs.conf.
  * Mke2fs now supports the reserved_ratio relation in mke2fs.conf.
  * Mke2fs now creates extent-mapped directories for the root and
      lost+found directories.
  * Mke2fs will skip zero'ing the journal if the extended option
      "lazy_journal_init" is specified.

      extended attributes and with time- and mount count-based file
      system checks disabled.

       block device attributes obtained from sysfs.
   * Mke2fs now displays a progress report during the discard process.

       searched-for block as an extended attribute block.
   * Debugfs now has a new "punch" command which remove blocks from the
       middle of an inode.
   * The badblocks program now correctly recovers from I/O errors when
       direct I/O is being used.  The badblocks command now also
       supports a -B option which forces the use of buffered I/O, and
       the -v option will provide a more detailed breakdown of read,
       write, and failed comparison errors.
   * Added e4defrag tool which uses the EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT ioctl.
   * Added support for journals larger than 2GB.
   * Support using both hard links and symlinks when installing e2fsprogs.

  * E2fsck now tests for extents that begin at physical block 0 and
    rejects them as invalid.
  * Fixed a bug in e2fsck which could cause it to crash when trying to
    remove an invalid extent and the block bitmaps hadn't yet been loaded.
  * E2fsck will now completely skip time-based checks if the system
    clock looks insane or if the broken_system_clock option is set

  * Fixed a bug in e2fsck which caused e2fsck to complain about i_blocks
    with a 4T file created using posix_fallocate()
  * E2fsck will now correctly mark a sparse journal as invalid and will
    delete and recreate the journal to address the problem.
  * Fixed e2fsck not to ask permission from the user to abort if it's
    going to abort regardless of what the user is going to say...
  * E2fsck can now continue even if it fails to recreate the resize inode
  * E2fsck will now avoid removing directory entries for inodes found in
    the unused region of the inode table until after it restarts the fs
    check to avoid removing valid data.
  * E2fsck will now longer try to set the block group checksums if it

  * Debugfs's "logdump -b <blk>" now properly shows the allocation status
    of the block <blk>.  (Closes: #564084)
  * Make e2fsck's "the filesystem is mounted" message is now more scary
    to hopefully dissuade users from thinking, "surely that message
    doesn't apply to *me*"  :-(
  * e2fsck -n will now always open the file system read-only.   We now
    disallow certain combination of options which previously were manual
    exceptions; this is bad because it causes users to think they are
    smarter than they really are.   So "-n -c", "-n -l", "-n -L", and
    "-n -D" are no longer supported.
  * If the partition is badly aligned, have mke2fs just print a warning
    message and continue.  Previously mke2fs would ask to confirm, and
    this broke distro installation scripts.
  * Fix a bug in libext2fs caused the creation of very large journals
    for ext4 to be _very_ slow.
  * E2fsck now understands the EOFBLOCKS_FL flag which will be used in
    2.6.34 kernels to make e2fsck not complain about blocks deliberately

  * Teach e2fsck to detect and fix sparse extent-mapped directories
  * Fix filefrag from core dumping on file systems with 8k block sizes
  * E2fsck was depending on i_size to be correct to detect and fix
    certain directory problems before actually fixing the
    directory's i_size.  This caused certain rare corruptions to
    require two runs of e2fsck to address.

    non-indexed directories.
  * Add support for calling BLKDISCARD to mke2fs.

    the first line.
  * Fix resize2fs so it works correctly on file systems with external journals
  * Fix libss so that it does not seg fault when using a readline
    library which does not supply a readline_shutdown() function.
  * Add a pre-depends for util-linux-ng (Closes: #551795)
  * Update and clarify various man pages.
  * Corrected dumpe2fs's usage message
  * Teach libext2fs to ignore the high 32 bits of the i_blocks field
    when huge_file file system feature is set, but the inode does not
    have the HUGE_FILE_FL flag set.
  * Change e2fsck to accept superblock times to be fudged by up to 24
    hours by default.  Most distributions have fixed their init scripts,
    but apparently now they have buggy virtualization scripts.  :-(  I
    give up, too many buggy user space set ups out there.  (Closes: #557636)
  * Fix e2fsck to correctly print > 32-bit i_blocks numbers in problem reports
  * Improve e2fsck so it prints "Illegal indirect block" instead of

    it to populate the superblock stride and stripe sizes and warn if
    the block device is misaligned

  * Fix a file descriptor leak in fsck
  * Round up the bitmap size to prevent spurious segmentation faults on
    BSD platforms.

  * Fix tune2fs -I to work correctly in the face of bad blocks and
    filesystems formatted for RAID arrays, and ENOSPC errors
  * Require the user to only answer one question instead of multiple
    ones for multiple bad block group checksums, or when an inode
    table needs to be moved.
  * Fix e2fsck to handle moving inode tables in FLEX_BG filesystems more
    gracefully by looking in the entire flex_bg for space, instead of
    just in the block group; if that doesn't work, try looking for
    space in the entire filesystem.
  * Fix the filefrag code to avoid printing the extent header if it
    needs to fallback to using the FIBMAP ioctl.
  * Fix filefrag to print the correct number of extents for zero-length

  * Add a filefrag -B option to make it easier to debug the FIBMAP
    support.
  * Allow e2fsprogs programs to allocate from uninitialized block groups.
  * Add a new program, e2freefrag, which displays information about the
    free space fragmentation in an ext2/3/4 filesystem.
  * E2fsck will now print much fuller information when the last mount
    time or last written time is in the future, since most people can't
    seem to believe their distribution has buggy init scripts, or they
    have a failed CMOS/RTS clock battery.
  * Update French, Polish, Czech, and Swedish translation from the
    Translation Project.
  * Enhance debugfs's 'stat' command to print basic extent information

  * Fix spelling mistake in Debian changelog (Closes: #502323)
  * Fix blkid to deal with an ext3 filesystem with the test_fs flag
  * Fix debugfs's ncheck output to suppress extra characters at the end
    of the file name
  * Tune2fs now updates the block group checksums after changing the
    filesystem's UUID
  * Speed up tune2fs's inode resizing code so it is no longer vastly
    inefficient for moderate to large filesystems

    information on filesystems with an external journal
  * Update the Catalan translation
  * Filter out linux-vdso.so lines when determining the library
    dependencies while building the initial ramdisk (Closes: #503057)
  * Fix e2fsck so an errant INODE_UNINIT flag set in a block group
    doesn't cause e2fsck to abort.
  * E2fsck now distinguishes between fragmented directories and
    fragmented files in verbose mode statistics and in the fragcheck
    report.
  * Avoid double-counting non-contiguous extent-based inodes in the
    verbose mode statistics.
  * E2fsck now leaves slack space when repacking directories so that a
    few new directory entries won't cause leaf nodes to become split
    right away.
  * E2fsck was previously not handling the case of a corrupted interior
    node in the extent tree, and would crash in that case.  It now will
    handle this and related failures robustly.
  * E2fsck problem descriptions involving the journal are no longer
    referred to as "ext3" problems, since ext4 filesystems also have
    journals.
  * Fix a long-standing bug in e2fsck which would cause it to crash when
    replying journals for filesystems with block sizes greater than 8k.
  * Fix a regression in debugfs's logdump command so it works for
    filesystems with 32-bit block numbers.  This was accidentally broken
    when the header files were changed to support the 64-bit block numbers.
  * Fix resize2fs for ext4 filesystems.  Some blocks that that need moving
    when shrinking filesystems with uninit_bg feature would not be
    moved.  In addition, blocks and inode table blocks were not being
    correctly freed when shrinking filesystems with the flex_bg feable,
    which caused resize2fs -M to fail.  Finally, when blocks are moved,
    make sure the uninitialized flag in extents is preserved.
  * Add mkfs.ext4 symlink to the e2fsprogs-udeb package (Closes: #511207)
  * Resize2fs now reserves some extra block when calculating the minimum
    size to shrink the filesystem in case some extent allocation trees
  * Add a "set -e" to uuid-runtime's prerm script to make Lintian happy
  * The blkid library will now recognize btrfs filesystems and swap
    devices currently used by user-level software suspend.
  * tune2fs will not allow changing the inode size for filesystems that
    have the flex_bg feature enabled, since the code currently assumes
    the each block group's portion inode table is located in its own
    block group.
  * Fix tune2fs -I so it won't corrupt ext3/ext4 filesystem configured
    for RAID storage devices.
  * Mke2fs now understands a -U option which allows the UUID to be
    specified for the new filesystem.
  * Mke2fs will now treat devices with exactly 16TB as if they have 16TB
    minus one block, since many users expect ext4 to support 16TB
    devices, and the true maximum size is 16TB-1.
  * E2fsck will now flag filesystems that have an insane s_first_ino
    field in their superblock.

  * Add an early check to see if a device is read-only to avoid lots of
    confusing error messages.
  * Fix debugfs's ncheck command so it prints all of the names of
    hardlinks in the same directories.
  * Fix a bug in libblkid so it correctly detects whether the ext4 and

  * Fix a potential file descriptor leak in libcom_err if the
      application exec's another program.
  * Fixed badblocks output for "badblocks -sw"
  * debugfs: Fix ncheck to print all pathnames for all of the specified inodes

  * Add support for on-line resizing of ext4 filesystems with the
       flex_bg filesystem feature.
  * e2fsck now creates the journal in the middle of the filesystem,
       which can speed up fsync-heavy workloads.

    from disk (for background scrubbing) and abort after a finding
    giving a number of errors.
  * Add support for ext4 filesystem features.  (Closes: #388452, #425477)
  * Tune2fs can migrate a filesystem from using 128 byte inodes to
    larger inode sizes so the user can take full advantage of ext4)
  * E2fsck and mke2fs can optionally record an undo log which can be
    replayed by the e2undo program.
  * E2fsck will display a less cryptic message when the last check field
    in the superblock is in the future.  (Closes: #446005)
  * Improve blkid probes for LVM volumes and swap partitions
  * Mke2fs has a much more sophisticated system for controlling the
    parameters of newly created filesystems.  The -t option now is used
    to specify the filesystem type.  See the mke2fs and mke2fs.conf man
    pages for more details.
  * Resize2fs will now print the minimum needed filesystem size if given
    the -P option, and will resize the filesystem to the smallest possible
    size if given the -M option.
  * E2fsck now performs more extensive and careful checks of extended
    attributes stored in the inode.
  * Mke2fs will always make sure that lost+found always has at least 2
    blocks, even for filesystems with very large blocksizes (i.e., 64kb).
  * The debugfs "ls" command now supports the -p option, which causes
    filenames to be printed surrounded by double quotes.
  * Fix a potential off-by-one buffer overflow in e2image

e2fsprogs (1.40.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mke2fs will now create new filesystems with 256 byte inodes and the
      ext_attr feature flag by default.  This allows for much better
      future compatibility with ext4 and speeds up extended attributes
      even on ext3 filesystems.
  * Teach mke2fs and tune2fs to set a "test_fs" flag, which indicates
      that it is ok to use the filesystem on in-development kernel
      code (i.e., ext4dev)
  * E2fsck now optimizes non-htree directories by sorting them by inode
      number.
  * Add support for detecting HFS+ and ext4/ext4dev filesystems in blkid
  * Fix blkid's ntfs UUID handling so it is compatible with vol_id
  * Avoid a floating point exception when blkid tries to probe a corrupt
      reiserfs filesystem.
  * Fix potential overflow problem in e2image if the device name is
      too long.
  * Cause e2image to exit immediately with an error message on a disk
      full situation.
  * Fix a minor typos in the resize2fs and uuidd manpages.
  * E2fsck will no longer backup superblocks when the kernel makes
      certain "safe" feature set changes behind the user's back.
  * Fix debugfs's lsdel command so it works on large files
  * Allow a user to undelete an inode with linking to a destination
      directory.
  * Update Swedish translation file from the Translation Project
  * The libuuid1 and uuid-runtime packages requires passwd package, so
      declare it as a dependency.  (Closes: #459403)

e2fsprogs (1.40.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure that programs like tune2fs, when modifying a mounted
      filesystem do not write the backup superblocks with the
      NEEDS_RECOVERY flag, to avoid e2fsck from needlessly forcing a
      full fsck because it thinks the feature flags need to be backed up
      from the master to the backup superblocks.  (Closes: #454926)
  * Improve time-based UUID generation to guarantee uniqueness even when
      UUID's are being generated at very high rates on SMP systems.  To
      do this we use an optional setuid helper daemon (uuidd) which is
      started by libuuid when it is needed.  The uuidd daemon is
      packaged in the (new) uuid-runtime package, which now also includes
      the uuidgen program (which had been previously been included as
      part of the e2fsprogs package).
  * Fix fsck to only treat '#' characters at the beginning of /etc/fstab
      lines as starting a comment.  This avoids spurious warnings printed
      for filesystems such as fuse that often use '#' as part of the
      filesystem specifier (i.e., wdfs#https://dav.hoster.com/foo).
  * Enhance the blkid program to pretty-print control and meta
      characters to avoid garbage filesystem labels from screwing up the
      user's terminal
  * Fix potential integer overflows passed to malloc() in resize2fs
  * Update Dutch, Polish, and Vietnamese translations from the
      Translation Project.  Remove the Rwandan translation upon advice
      of the Translation Project.
  * Fix cross-compilation support for non-Linux architectures
        (Closes: #451172, #437720)
  * Clarified and improved man pages (Closes: #444883, #441872)
  * Fix potential divide by zero error when libblkid tried probing an
      invalid FAT filesystem.
  * Make error_message() in libcom_err DTRT when when a 64-bit sign-extended
      error code is passed to it.
  * Build the e2fsck-static package so that e2fsck.static will not use
      TLS and hence will run correctly on back-level Debian systems
      using a 2.4 Linux kernel.  (Closes: #458017)

  * Don't use special cflags at configure time when building the special

e2fsprogs (1.27+1.28-WIP-0626-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release:
  ** Supports v2 ACL format (Closes: #138160).
  * Removed explicit --mandir flag, as it now uses FHS man location by
    default.
  * Added mkinitrd script, "upstream-contributed" ;) by Ted Ts'o (Closes:
    #148064).
  * Build a no-pic version of libext2fs.a on mips and mipsel, patch by
    Florian Lohoff, adapted for style consistency (Closes: #145432).
  * Removed presumably-useless and presumably-broken CFLAGS propagation.
    If someone misses that, I'll add ${CFLAGS} to --ccopts.

  * Switched to debhelper v4.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to all packages' Depends field.

  * Fixed typos in fsck.8, added an example for clarity (Closes:
    #145044).
  * Fixed typo in chattr manpage (Closes: #141938).
  * Fixed typo in tune2fs manpage (Closes: #148514).

e2fsprogs (1.27-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium since this fixes a RC bug.
  * Generate the shlibs file instead of just copying it in place, and make
    it produce deps on "e2fsprogs (>= <current>)" as well, to cope with
    new functions introduced in the libs (Closes: #139274).
  * Added a note on this in README.Debian.

  * No more use for dh_link'ing *.ext[23], it's now done by upstream

  * Only include (new) inode_io.o from libext2fs when fileio.o is, or the
    BF build fails because of this additional (unused) member (upstream

e2fsprogs (1.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This uploads fixes 10 bugs, including data-corruption problems, and
    adds much to the ease of maintenance and problem tracking.  Good
    choice for woody.

  * New upstream release (Closes: #106622, #116975, #118443, #119624,
    #120171, #120077, #129828, #132764).
  ** Fixes for data-corruption bugs not reported to the BTS: e2fsck
    trashed external journals needing to be replayed, e2fsck now hides
    visible journal files (data corruption problems when not excluded from
    a backup and then restored) (Closes: #132654).
  ** Other noticeable bugs fixed include: e2fsck null pointer
    dereferencing, fsck did not finds LVM volumes by UUID or by label,
    largefile support (ie. dealing with filesystems inside 2GB+ files) was
    broken in several programs.
  * Switch to debhelper v3 to get ldconfig automatically handled
    (lintian reported that it was broken).  Now call dh_makeshlibs, but
    still override its generated shlibs file with ours, to get compiled
    packages depend of the correct virtual packages, which include
    full sonames.
  * Removed call do dh_installman (Closes: #115526).
  * Cleaned up maintainer scripts with dead code - most things are now
    more properly handled by debhelper.  Removed an "exit 0" lurking in
    preinst - can't find a reason for it in the changelog, it was probably
    here for ages.
  * Remove obsolete maint-scripts in binary-arch, as they are provided by
    upstream.
  * Also remove upstream-shipped config.cache before configuring.  That
    shouldn't impact us, but well, that makes lintian happy :)

  * com_err.info provided again now that it was fixed upstream.
  * Added metainfo to com_err.texinfo so that it gets indexed correctly
    (thanks lintian).  Moved @setfilename and @settitle to the top so that
    things get output as expected.
  * Added lintian overrides for -bf and -static packages.
  * Put all stamp files in debian/stampdir.

e2fsprogs (1.24a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release (Closes: #109577).
  ** The only new code in there is in codepaths that
    are only visited when previously unsupported features are used, so
    they add virtually no risk.  Support for raw image files will be of
    great help to debug users' problems.  Urgency set to "high" to make
    sure this version gets released with woody.

  ** Fsck prints a warning message if now valid filesystems are passed to
    it. (Closes: #107458).
  ** Fsck -A will not try to interpret device names for filesystems which
    have a pass number is 0. (Closes: #106696).
  ** If -O none is passed to mke2fs, it will now not set the sparse_super
    feature (Closes: #108165).
  ** Tune2fs has been fixed to make sure that only error messages go to
    stderr, and normal message go to stdout (Closes: #108555).
  ** Minor man pages updates (Closes: #30833, #108174).
  ** Doc fixes (Closes: #110621).

  * This is only a trivial patch to stop some user confusion, and would be
    great to have in woody, hence the urgency.
  * Applied upstream patch to e2fsck to warn user when some errors were
    not corrected due to user answering "no" (Closes: #104502).

  * Cleanup generated substvars files now that debhelper uses other
    names (may cause problems on other archs).  Build-dep on debhelper
    3.0.30 or newer to be sure it won't cause broken uploads.  Allows to
    get rid of hairy dep, but cannot build straightforwardly on potato any
    more...

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jun 2001 02:33:32 +0200

    tune2fs.
  * New binary package with statically linked e2fsck, recommending a
    statically linked shell (Closes: #62611).
  * All deps against e2fsprogs itself now versioned (lintian).
  * Updated copyright file (upstream location, packaging copyright notice
    for previous maintainers and for Alcove).
  * Remove call to dh_testversion, use versioned build-dep instead
    (lintian).
  * Support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug/nostrip for policy 3.2
    compliance.
  * Use dh_shlibdeps -l instead of setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitly -
    necessary for new versions of fakeroot, and requires debhelper 3.0.23
    for a fix.  Well finally 3.0.23 is buggy, leave this for later.
  * Avoid to call ldconfig at "make install" time, too costly.

      (BUILD_CC): Discover a native compiler if we are cross-compiling
